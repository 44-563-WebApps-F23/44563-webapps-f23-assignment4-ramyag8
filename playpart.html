    <h1>Ramya Gopalam acts in a play</h1>

    <h3>Ghosts</h3>
    <h4>Act Second By Henrik Ibsen Translated, with an Introduction, by William Archer</h4>

    <p>MRS. ALVING.: 
        [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
        equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
        on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
        you coming too, Oswald?</p>
    <p>OSWALD.: 
        [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.</p>
    <p>MANDERS.: 
        Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
        utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p>
    <p>ENGSTRAND.: 
        Well, it was just this, your Reverence: we've been paid off
        down yonder--my grateful thanks to you, ma'am,--and now everything's
        finished, I've been thinking it would be but right and proper if we,
        that have been working so honestly together all this time--well, I was
        thinking we ought to end up with a little prayer-meeting to-night.</p> 
    <p>REGINA.: 
        Yes, ma'am. It's ready lighted. [Goes out.]</p>
    <p>MANDERS.: 
        [Noticing her for the first time.] What--? You here? And with a
        glass in your hand!</p> 
    <p>MRS. ALVING.: 
        Yes, of course. Come, Regina. [She and REGINA hasten out
        through the hall.]</p>
