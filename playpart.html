    <h1>Ramya Gopalam acts in a play</h1>

    <h3>Ghosts</h3>
    <h4>Act Second By Henrik Ibsen Translated, with an Introduction, by William Archer</h4>

    <h6> ALVING.: </h6>
    <p> <p> [Still in the doorway.] </p>
     _Velbekomme_ 
     <p>[Note: A phrase
        equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
        on appetite.] </p>
        , Mr. Manders. 
        <p>[Turns back towards the dining-room.]</p>
         Aren't you coming too, Oswald?</p>
    <h6>OSWALD.:</h6>
    <p> <p>[From within.] </p> 
    No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.</p>
    <h6>MANDERS.: </h6>
    <p> Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
        utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p>
    <h6>ENGSTRAND.:</h6>
    <p> Well, it was just this, your Reverence: we've been paid off
        down yonder--my grateful thanks to you, ma'am,--and now everything's
        finished, I've been thinking it would be but right and proper if we,
        that have been working so honestly together all this time--well, I was
        thinking we ought to end up with a little prayer-meeting to-night.</p> 
    <h6>REGINA.:</h6>
    <p> Yes, ma'am. It's ready lighted. 
        <p>[Goes out.]</p></p>
    <h6>MANDERS.:</h6>
    <p> <p> [Noticing her for the first time.] </p> What--? You here? And with a
        glass in your hand!</p> 
    <h6>MRS. ALVING.:</h6>
    <p> Yes, of course. Come, Regina.
        <p> [She and REGINA hasten out
        through the hall.]</p> </p>
